## About me

I have deep knowledge of JavaScript and have been using it since 1996. I launched a business building full-stack web sites and loaned out my JavaScript skills to other design companies that needed my computer science and software development expertise for their apps, components, libraries, games, animations, data visualizations, algorithms, and custom software. I've been programming since childhood (starting with a flavor of Fortran!) and working in web development as long as there's been a web to develop for. 

I have a master's degree in information technology, 4.0 GPA.

For the last decade I've focused on web development education as a technical training specialist, curriculum developer, instructional designer, and technical writer. I've helped well over three thousand students learn HTML, CSS, JavaScript (including frameworks like React, Next, Svelte, etc.), Node, database design and management, computer science, application development, SDLC, Agile, programming paradigms, algorithmic thinking, efficiency, accessibility, web security, navigating constantly evolving best practices, and surviving a coding boot camp.
