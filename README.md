I'm Ian. Thanks for coming.

## About me

I'm a senior software development author at [Pluralsight](https://www.pluralsight.com/authors/ian-marshall-bc), where I combine my expertise and passions in software engineering, web development, training, instructional design, and helping people get better at their tough jobs.

I have deep knowledge of JavaScript and have been using it since 1996, when I launched a business building full-stack web sites. I also loaned out my JavaScript skills to other design companies that needed my computer science and software development expertise for apps, components, libraries, games, animations, data visualizations, algorithms, and custom software. I've been programming since childhood (Fortran!) and working in web development as long as there's been a web to develop for. 

I have a master's degree in information technology, 4.0 GPA.

For the last decade I've focused on web development education as a technical training specialist, curriculum developer, instructional designer, technical writer, and content creator. I've helped well over three thousand students learn HTML, CSS, JavaScript (including frameworks like React, Next, Svelte, etc.), Node, database design and management, computer science, application development, SDLC, Agile, programming paradigms, algorithmic thinking, efficiency, accessibility, web security, navigating constantly evolving best practices, and surviving a coding boot camp.
